<h1>3x3 Matrix Adjoint in C Sharp</h1>
<p>In this project we will be calculating the adjoint of a 3x3 matrix in c#.In order to understand this code first we need to
see how to know how to find the adjoint of a matrix by an example.Here is an example you can learn from also compare the values from the code to
check the accuracy of the program.

<h2>Output Testing</h2>
<p>
If you want to check weather the output the program is giving is true or false then <a href="https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/adjoint-matrix-calculator/">this</a> online tool might just help.
